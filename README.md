### Summary - Feature Engineering & EDA

Two derived features were created to capture clinically meaningful information beyond the raw variables. Smoker intensity was defined as the product of current smoking status and the number of cigarettes smoked per day, allowing differentiation between non-smokers, light smokers, and heavy smokers, while assigning zero exposure to non-smokers. Pulse pressure was computed as the difference between systolic and diastolic blood pressure and serves as an indicator of arterial stiffness and cardiovascular risk. These engineered features aim to incorporate interaction effects and physiological relationships that may not be fully captured by individual variables alone.

The data frame was saved as engineered_df.csv.

Exploratory data analysis was conducted to examine the relationship between baseline characteristics and ten-year coronary heart disease (CHD) status. Age, pulse pressure and systolic blood pressure show the strongest univariate associations with CHD, with distributions for CHD cases shifted toward higher values compared to non-CHD cases. However, substantial overlap remains, indicating only moderate separability when these variables are considered individually. Other continuous variables, including diastolic blood pressure, body mass index, glucose, and total cholesterol, exhibit weaker differences and considerable overlap between groups. Categorical variables such as sex, prevalent hypertension, blood pressure medication use, and diabetes suggest associations with CHD risk, although small subgroup sizes and class imbalance limit their standalone discriminatory power. Overall, no single variable clearly separates CHD from non-CHD cases, highlighting the need for multivariable modeling to capture combined effects.
