# Model Development
In this section 4 different architectures have been used to develop different models in order to predict the coronary disease. 

To obtain the metrics for each model, the dataset has been split into two datasets in a 0.8/0.2 proportion, so no cross-validation has been done, and the metrics might be optimistic.
Class unbalanced has been addressed, and different models changing hyperparameters have been tested to try to obtain the best results. The trained models are saved in dictionaries for each architecture and the results for each model are displayed. These results include accuracy, recall and other important statistics.

The results obtained show that none of the models used is perfect and some more advanced and complex models might be needed in order to obtain the best results.
